# Catching_Falling_Objects

Cathcing Falling Objects is game where objects fall from the top of screen and the user must catch the objects. I am doing a similar game to this but instead of having random objects fall I will have balls fall from the top of the screen. The user then must catch the falling balls using the mouse. The user has a certain amount of lives and for each ball that falls to the bottom of the screen the user loses a life. The game is coded in Java and utilizes the Slick2D api.
